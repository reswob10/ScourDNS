CHANGELOG

28 Feb 2013

-- changed how configuration works so that it does not overwright the old config file until you have confirmed the new configuration.
-- Removed last traces of using a separate file to add to the blacklist. Any additions/subtractions to the black list are done to files listed in the configuration
